INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

It is a dark and silent place. The man, as soon as he enters, sees something in the center of the room that seems to disturb him deeply. With an uncertain, nervous step, he approaches the reason for his bewilderment of him.

The restaurant has all the tables cleared, except the one in the center, where another man is sitting, who seems to be waiting for the protagonist. He is identical to him in every respect: the clothes, the hairstyle, the face.

MICHELE
Welcome. You can call me Michele. Please sit down.

The man hesitates for a moment, but, being too confused to do anything else, he obeys. The table is covered with a long white tablecloth. On the side where the man sat down, there is a box of handkerchiefs, and a plate without cutlery. On the plate, there is a chocolate still wrapped. Once seated, the man is unable to stop staring at Michele.

MICHELE
(smiles slightly)
Don't worry, it's a shock to everyone. I would say to start immediately. As I said, you can call me Michele, and I have been assigned to guide you in this new phase. It is very likely that you just woke up with a feeling of deep distress, right? A feeling that something terrible has happened.
