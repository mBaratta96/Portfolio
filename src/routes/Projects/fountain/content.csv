0,Synopsis,"A man, with an unknown name, wakes up on a deserted rocky beach. He doesn't know who he is, or why he's there. Looking for someone to ask for help, he walks into a restaurant where there is a person waiting for him. His name is Michele, and it is identical, in every aspect of his body, to the protagonist. Conversing with Michele, he discovers that he is dead and that he is in the afterlife. Michele is an entity charged with explaining his new condition to him.\nThe world in which they find themselves is in fact the new, more modern and efficient version of Hell: an otherworldly place that is in all respects the same as the world in which we live, but inhabited by no one else besides the protagonist, who he will then find himself living in absolute solitude for the rest of eternity.\nMichele leads the protagonist to the place where he woke up and shows him the reason why he received this punishment: the protagonist has in fact strangled, for a slip of jealousy, his girlfriend.\nUnable to accept his situation, the protagonist tries to figure out how to get out of this reality. He first considers throwing himself off the balcony of his house, believing that this will make him wake up in another world exactly as one usually wakes up from a nightmare. Michele, however, immediately blocks him, and makes him understand that there is no easy way to escape the punishment inflicted. The only path that could work is total repentance: the decision to inflict on oneself the same pain that one caused others.\nThe protagonist chooses to hang himself to show that he is ready to feel the same pain inflicted on the girl he had loved. However, as soon as the rope is stretched, it breaks for no apparent reason, letting the protagonist fall to the ground in a state of uncertainty and confusion. While he tries to redo the knot of the noose, the protagonist realizes that he does not have the courage to carry out the punishment he wants to inflict and returns to his house. He sits down at the living room table, and starts scribbling something to pass the time."
1,,"In the first scene, I would like to present the protagonist in an environment that could reflect his nature of mediocre, spoiled and self-centered man. He is a person without an actual identity, or at least an identity that he decided to forge by himself. Through the movie, we will understand that all of his action are driven by ego, by the desperate search of someone else's approval. To represent all of this, I pictured an empty environment, in which the dry Mediterranean vegetation is nothing but a frame for rocks and concrete. Therefore, the soul of the protagonist is as arid as the surrounding environment."
2,,"If the protagonist is a body without a soul, Michele is a soul without a body. Therefore, I thought that the best idea to express this concept was to have the same actor playing both of the characters, and using the dialogue as an instrument to separate these two personalities. Michele is clever, well-spoken, and has also his own personal sense of humor. The protagonist, on the contrary, is timid, express himself with few, short sentences and there's a constant flickering of incertitude in his voice. (As a side note: the duplication of the actor has been realized with the help of an AI algorithm. Take a look <a href='https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a> if you feel curious.)"
3,,"I though the best way to further express the nature of the protagonist is to create this hallucination. I thought it could be a clever way to show his egocentrism: when there is nobody that could possibly look at him, here's an eye that can judge him."
