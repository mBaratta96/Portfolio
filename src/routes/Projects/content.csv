0,Synopsis,"The film covers the time span between 1888 and 1911. The two characters represent composers Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, and they recite in voice-over a loose adaptation of the letters they exchanged for more than 20 years.\nWe see the development of their long-distance friendship across some pivotal events of their lives — Mahler's composition (and subsequent flop) of his 2nd symphony, their fight against Austrian royal censorship for the preparation of Strauss' Salome, the death of Mahler's daughter. As we assist at these episodes, the opposite natures of the two artists emerge. Mahler is a tormented spirit that constantly fights to expand the limits of the musical form, Strauss is a confident and productive artist whose sensibility is perfectly in line with his time.\nThe narration presents many anachronisms — emails, YouTube clips and Metacritic reviews. Although extravagant, these inserts are all meant to further explore the themes of the movie, such as the struggle of the artist, the beauty of making art, and the friendship between two opposite human beings."
