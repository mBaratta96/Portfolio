EXT. ROCKS - DAY
The cold, restless sea throws itself on the rocks in a desperate struggle. The air is humid, so cold it cuts through the lungs. No seagull sings its chant in the cloudy sky. No vehicles cross the overpass in the distance. No sign of life, except for a man lying on the rocks who has just regained consciousness.

He gets up, and looks around. It seems like a familiar place, but at the moment he can't remember anything specific. Suddenly, a stinging pain in one side of the neck - touching with one hand, he realizes that he has a large scratch that has not yet healed.

At the bottom of the beach, he notices a narrow staircase carved into the rocks, which seems to lead to a square that overlooks the whole area. Not having a better plan, the man decides to go up.
